## ABLeS co-authorship policy

Authorship is NOT expected for routine / simple services provided (e.g. tool installation) and an acknowledgement is sufficient in these cases. We approach authorship issues with a generous spirit and aim to fairly attribute contributions.

In some cases, it may be appropriate for ABLeS support staff, or specialists at NCI or Pawsey to be co-authors on publications. Examples of this include when these specialists provide significant input into the publication, including a significant contribution to method / protocol / pipeline development, study design, data and results analysis, or interpretation.
