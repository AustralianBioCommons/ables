## ABLeS process for different stages of a project's lifetime

The Australian BioCommons and the bioinformatics leads for each group have different roles in initiation, onboarding and reporting for ABLeS. 

ABLeS projects are led and maintained by their users with the support of the ABLeS team to facilitate access to ABLeS resources. 

If you are new to the ABLeS program, please read the processes below in order to start using ABLeS resources or **[contact us](contact-us.md)** for more information and assistance.

            <li>Installing tools, software, pipelines when a special support is needed. </li>
            <li>Optimising workflows and software to be used by all projects.</li>
            <li>Developing and improving cross-cutting tools and workflows.</li>
            <li>Managing the allocation of resources for projects and add default resources at the begining of each quarter.</li>
          </ol>
          We realise that communities will have different capabilities and different needs. Therefore, ABLeS support will adapt to suit these aspects and aim to provide the best possible support to the communities in order to do their work efficiently.

## ABLeS Expectations

|Principle| Description|
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Project leadership**| A project lead is responsible for all use of resources provided, which will need to adhere to relevant facility processes and policies. The lead will also monitor and manage reasonable usage of their project computational infrastructure allocations.|
|**Community-level decision making**| There exists a collaborative decision making mechanism to prioritise the bioinformatics work using relevant computational resources. This can be a formalised steering committee, a working group, or some other forum which is representative of the collaboration. Resources used must be agreed upon / in line with the communityâ€™s decision making mechanism and align with community priorities.|
|**Community-level expertise**|The community has expertise which will drive and execute its bioinformatics agenda. This expertise offers a strong collaboration link with the expertise and support available through ABLeS, NCI and Pawsey.|
|**Collaboration & consultation**|ABLeS is collaborative and involves the BioCommons, the research community, and the computational facilities. It is also a standing item for discussion and forums play a strong role in managing the use of ABLeS: communities will thus engage the BioCommons in an open and collaborative manner, with regular meetups.|
|**Follow compute facility access policies**|All users must abide by the relevant access policies of Pawsey and NCI. NCI Terms and Conditions of Access; NCI Data Collections Management; and Pawsey Conditions of Access.|
|**Time frame / duration of allocations**|Each project is reviewed at the 6 month mark, to ensure resources are being used as efficiently as practical and so challenges can be identified / addressed by the ABLeS team. Reference data and production projects are by definition on-going, while software accelerator projects need to be renewed at 6 months if the work originally described for the project has not been completed.|
