## Setting up an ABLeS community

The Australian BioCommons and the bioinformatics leads for each community have different roles in initiation, onboarding and reporting for ABLeS. 

ABLeS projects are led and maintained by their [communities](communities.md) with the support of the ABLeS team to facilitate the access to ABLeS resources. 

If you are new to ABLeS program, please follow the diagram below in order to start using ABLeS resources or **[contact us](contact-us.md)** for more information and assistance.

|                    **BioCommons** | **BioCommons will**  <br/>BioCommons initiates an ABLeS community through: <br/>1. Creation of a project allocation at the NCI for a community <br/>2. Inviting community bioinformatics leads to a project allocation as Chief Investigators <br/>3. Providing information on how to utilise ABLeS resources and contribute to the shared tool and software repository.<br/>  Biocommons manage the resources available to the ABLeS programme across all active communities.                      | **BioCommons can assist with** <br/>Biocommons helps communities to overcome different challenges that may appear: <br/> 1. Installing tools, software, pipelines when a special support is needed. <br/>2. Optimising workflows and software to be used by all communities. <br/>3. Developing and improving cross-cutting tools and workflows. <br/>4. Managing the allocation of resources for communities. <br/>We realise that communities will have different capabilities and different needs. Therefore, ABLeS support will adapt to suit these aspects and aim to provide the best possible support to the communities in order to do their work efficiently.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Community bioinformatics lead** | **Community bioinformatics leads should** <br/> 1. Submit a project plan that contains the details of the project ([link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf9UVEuhbAsbvVzTEvvE9mLoietryb7e3sDmv74Xhl-1YWj2Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)). The communityâ€™s steering committee should approve the plan. <br/>2. Identify known existing challenges, that BioCommons or the NCI may be able to address and / or support as part of ABLeS. You can use the GoogleForm to let us know about these challenges. | **Community bioinformatics leads should** <br/>1. Request additional resources ([link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzHJajEKTnGuYWb1gLRR2nlUExLIRM7qSGy_hhbiCKB3KX2Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)) when the community needs more resources than the available. Each community gets 100 KSUs automatically at the beginning of each quarter without the need to request them. <br/>2. Attend a quarterly meeting with BioCommons to discuss and report the outcomes of the community work (data, methods, publications..) in the last quarter.<br/>3. Community bioinformatics leads manage the resources provided by ABLeS including:<br/>a) Adding members to the community projects.<br/> b) Educating / onboarding new members on ABLeS projects.<br/>c) Contributing and / or coordinating contributions to the shared tool and software repository (if89), as well as encouraging community contribution. |
