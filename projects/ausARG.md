## Details

The [Australian Amphibian and Reptile Genomics Initiative (AusARG)](https://ausargenomics.com/) is a national collaborative project that will facilitate research using genomics approaches towards a more thorough understanding of evolution and conservation of Australia’s unique native Amphibians and Reptiles that are now under threat, through climate, disease or habitat modification.

The mission of the Australian Amphibian and Reptile Genomics (AusARG) initiative is to build genomic resources to understand and protect Australia’s reptiles and amphibians.
