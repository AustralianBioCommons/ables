## Details

This project is funded by Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and the Australian BioCommons. 

Objectives:

- Design, develop, test, and optimise an end-to-end nf-ONTvisc workflow for the diagnosis of plant and insect viruses using ONT long read data collected via whole genome metagenomics sequencing and / or amplicon targeted sequencing.

- Assess the performance of nf-ONTvisc workflow for running on diverse platforms including on-prem HPC and national compute infrastructure facilities (Pawsey Supercomputing Centre and the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI)).

- Prepare a hands-on training user guide for the upskilling of end users and make the resource available through appropriate platforms.
