## Details

The aim of the project is to develop and analyse the splicing profiles and structural rearrangement events within the RNA samples that cannot be identified through fusion detection algorithms. This project will develop the pipeline and then analyse all 700+ patients to identify novel structural rearrangement events occurring in the RNA and unique splicing profiles that are specific to high-risk paediatric cancers. The development of this pipeline and analysis will then be integrated into the current RNA pipeline that will be ran prospectively on all new patients enrolled on ZERO.

The analysis will be carried out using MINTIE (available on github) and rMATS. Both methodologies will be tested and compared to determine which algorithm to continue using or if both are required.
