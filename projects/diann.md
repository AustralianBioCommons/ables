## Details

Scanning SWATH is a novel method that now enables rapid mass spectrometry of hundreds of peptide samples, but the ability to process the resulting spectra using DIA-NN software is much more demanding and extends beyond the capability of most mass spectrometry facilities. This workflow will be available to all future users.

The workflow will enable rapid generation of unbiased quantitative data concerning the proteins present in high numbers of complex tissue samples, obtained for example under different dietary or genetic conditions. This will enable further mechanistic investigation of the phenotypes observed.

We aspire to publish our studies in journals such as Cell Metabolism or Nature Communications. Data will be made freely available in a public database such as the ProteomeXchange Consortium.
Mouse species will be investigated during this project.

This is a new collaboration at the University of Sydney between the Precision Nutrition research group, School of Life and Environmental Sciences (CSP) and the Bioinformatics Group, Sydney Informatics Hub.
