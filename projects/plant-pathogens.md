## Details

This project aims to investigate plant pathogen genomics, population genetics, virulence evolution, fungicide resistance evolution, and diagnostics.

## Methods 

- Genome assembly, 
- Annotation, 
- Population genetics, and 
- Variation analysis

## Expected outcomes of the project

+ Genome resources for Australian biosecurity, 
+ New workflows, 
+ Publications, and 
+ Policy documents.

Raw data and genomes under embargo will be stored on the Bioplatforms Australia data portal. At the time of publication, data will be at NCBI / SRA for long term storage.
