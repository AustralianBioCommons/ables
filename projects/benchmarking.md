## Details

The goal of this project is to benchmark software that is commonly used throughout life sciences on Australia’s national HPC facilities. The software benchmarked will span research areas such as bioinformatics and molecular dynamics, as well as general software that is commonly used like [`NumPy`](https://bio.tools/numpy) and [`R`](https://bio.tools/r). The benchmarks also aim to test a variety of workloads, such as machine learning & artificial intelligence (ML/AI), traditional HPC (on a small to moderate scale), I/O dependent software (latency and bandwidth), and high throughput workloads.

Life science researchers will benefit from this as it will:

- Assist in planning, and monetary/time budgeting, for grants, 
- Provide a means for researchers to evaluate their own systems’ and/or software performance, 
- Help to differentiate between existing HPC platforms for researchers, and 
- Establish an easy-to-setup benchmarking pipeline – facilitated by [`Nextflow`](https://bio.tools/nextflow).

All results and the pipeline will be made publicly available via GitHub.
