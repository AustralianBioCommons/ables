## Details

The goal of this project is to benchmark software that is commonly used throughout lifesciences, on Australia’s national HPC facilities. The software benchmarked will span research areas such as bioinformatics, molecular dynamics, and general software that is commonly used like NumPy and R. The benchmarks also aim to test a variety of workloads, such as ML/AI, traditional HPC (on a small to moderate scale), IO dependant software (latency and bandwidth), and high throughput workloads.

Life science researchers will benefit from this as it will assist in planning and monetary/time budgeting for grants,  provide a means to evaluate their own systems’ and/or software performance, helping differentiate the existing HPC platforms for researchers, as well as establishing an easy-to-setup pipeline – facilitated by Nextflow.

All results and the pipeline will be made publicly available via GitHub.
