## Details

This project aims to investigate plant pathogen genomics, population genetics, virulence evolution, fungicide resistance evolution, and diagnostics. 
Methods: Genome assembly, Annotation, Population genetics, variation analysis. 

The expected outcomes of the project.

+ Genome resources for Australian biosecurity, new workflows, publications, and policy documents.

Outputs will be stored at BioPlatforms for raw data and genomes under embargo. NCBI, SRA for long term at time of publication.
