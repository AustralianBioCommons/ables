## Details

[Genomics for Australian Plants](https://www.genomicsforaustralianplants.com/) was initiated by Bioplatforms in partnership with researchers from the Australian State and National Herbaria and Botanic Gardens.

Broadly, the key aims of the Initiative are:

+ Sequence and assemble representative Australian plant genomes across across the plant tree of life to enable better conservation, utilisation and understanding of Australiaâ€™s unique plant diversity;

+ Build genomic capacity across Australian Botanic Gardens and Herbaria to create networks collaborating in the collection, management, dissemination and application of genomic data for Australian plants;

+ Provide tools to enable genomic data to be used to identify and classify biodiversity at a range of scales and to use these tools to inform conservation management and enable better decision making.
