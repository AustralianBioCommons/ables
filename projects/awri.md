## Details

Grapevine cultivars can be unequivocally typed by both physical differences (ampelography) and genetic tests. However, due to their very similar characteristics, the identification of clones within a cultivar relies on the accurate tracing of supply records to the point of origin. Such records are not always available or reliable, particularly for older accessions. 

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) provides the most highly detailed methodology for defining grapevine cultivars and more importantly, this can be extended to differentiating clones within those cultivars. The [AWRI](https://www.awri.com.au/) has developed a world-first clonal sequencing pipeline that has been successfully used to define grapevine clones as true-to-sequence. This information will underpin investments in replanting, facilitate vineyard recovery and improve income for Australian grape grower and wine producers.
