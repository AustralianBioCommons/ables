## Specialist expertise

ABLeS communities are supported by the NCI, Pawsey and ABLeS specialists to install, develop, optimise and deploy tools and workflows on ABLeS projects.
If you are part of an ABLeS community, and need help, please submit a request through the **[GoogleForm](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfzHJajEKTnGuYWb1gLRR2nlUExLIRM7qSGy_hhbiCKB3KX2Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)**.

## Computational resources at Pawsey

ABLeS includes 10 million service units (SUs) of compute capacity on [Setonix](https://pawsey.org.au/systems/setonix/) and flexible storage on the fast S3 based [Acacia](https://pawsey.org.au/systems/acacia/) storage system. These SUs can be utilised across CPU and GPU nodes. 

### Available software at Pawsey

There is a wide range of centrally installed software for Setonix users, including popular bioinformatics tools. More information about [software on Setonix](https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/display/US/Software+Stack)

Setonix users can also install their choice of software on the `/software` partition. We also encourage usage of containers with Singularity. Users are able to download any containers they like! 

### Reference datasets at Pawsey 
Popular bioinformatics [reference datasets](https://support.pawsey.org.au/documentation/display/US/Life+Science+and+Bioinformatics) are available on Pawsey. Additional reference sets can be requested via help@pawsey.org.au


## Computational resources at NCI

ABLeS encompasses 16 million service units (SUs) of compute capacity and 500 TB of storage available per annum on the [Gadi supercomputer at the NCI](https://nci.org.au/our-systems/hpc-systems). These SUs can be utilised to run jobs on different nodes of GADI that are equipped with either CPUs or GPUs.

- [Gadi storage system](https://nci.org.au/our-systems/storage-systems).

ABLes computational resources are allocated to each community according to the quarterly plan submitted by the bioinformatics lead of the community.

### Centrally supported tools and software through NCI (`/apps`)

Details about software available through the NCI are available [here](https://opus.nci.org.au/display/Help/5.+Software+Applications)

### Shared repository of tools and software

ABLeS communities have access to the `Australian BioCommons Tools and Workflows project`, in project allocation `if89`.
This is a repository of popular tools, containers and workflows that can be used by 
anyone in the NCI user community.
Anyone from an NCI community can contribute to `if89` and add more tools that will be shared with others.

Details on if89 are available at **[if89 page](/ables/if89/)**
