## Project description and aims

**Aims:**

1. Elucidate the interplay between cancer cell plasticity, and epigenetic and genetic evolution

2. Understand how cancer ecosystems enable cancer progression and treatment resistance

3. Develop methods to analyse the spatial distribution of tumour and
microenvironment cells

4. Predict disease progression and treatment response from patient PET and CT imaging

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?
This work is supported through the Production Bioinformatics scheme provided by ABLeS. The support includes 5 TB long term storage and 50 KSUs per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

We anticipate the development of tools, workflows and tertiary data. These will be shared in the form of publications, either focused on new methods or novel biological insights.
Tools and workflows developed will be made available in Bioconductor, Github, CRAN, etc. as per standard practices depending on language and intended audience. Data assets will be made publicly available in repositories such as EGA, GEO, etc. upon publication following data-sharing standard practices.
Tools and workflows can be accessed through: [https://github.com/TrigosTeam](https://github.com/TrigosTeam)
