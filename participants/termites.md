title:  Testing links between life-history and genome evolution
description: This project will investigate the formation of unusual chains of chromosomes that are increasingly being found in various vertebrate and invertebrate taxa, using an organism in which they are most commonly found, termites. We will test the hypothesis that inbreeding drives the evolution of meiotic sex linked chromosomes.

## Project title

Testing links between life-history and genome evolution

## Collaborators and funding

**Collaborators:**

- The University of Sydney
- The University of Melbourne
- Australian Research Council Discovery Project

- Maxim Adams, <maxim.adams@sydney.edu.au>

## Project description and aims

We will perform chromosome-scale long-read genome sequencing, population genomic, molecular evolutionary, and differential expression analyses on *G. nakajimai* and *N. insularis* to:

1. test the hypothesized links between inbreeding, deleterious mutation sheltering, and MSLC

2. determine how neo-Y chromosomes evolve at the molecular level and whether they display differential expression compared to neo-X chromosomes

3. examine the role of translocations in MSLC

Our project will provide major advances in our understanding of sex chromosome and genome evolution, which underpin biological diversification processes

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the production bioinformatics scheme provided by ABLeS. The supports includes unlimited temporary storage on scratch, 5 TB long-term storage and 50 KSUs allocation per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

We will generate genome sequences for a number of termite species, including Australian species which are pests of wood in service. These will be deposited in genome databanks. 
We will publish a number of papers on the genomes of termites, and their novel chromosome structures.
