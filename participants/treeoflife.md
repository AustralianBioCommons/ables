## Project title

Australian Tree of Life Infrastructure Establishment 

## Collaborators and funding

**Collaborators:**

- Bioplatforms Australia
- The University of Melbourne
- Minderoo Foundation

## Contact(s)

- Tom Harrop, Australian BioCommons, <tharrop@unimelb.edu.au>

## Project description and aims

The Australian Tree of Life will be a digital library of molecular data for species relevant to Australia, powered by:
1. A Genome Engine, enabling rapid, automated genome assembly, annotation and publication
2. Data labs that enhance use of genomics resources in biodiversity and biosecurity.

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the production bioinformatics scheme provided by ABLeS. The supports includes unlimited temporary storage on scratch, 2 TB long-term storage and 50 KSUs allocation per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

- Genomes and annotations will be published in INSDC databases
- Genome reports will be published in Genome Note format (location TBC)
