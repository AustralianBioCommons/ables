title:  Producing a haplotype-resolved germline Ig/TR reference assembly with high-fidelity whole genome sequencing in commonly-used laboratory mouse strains.
description: Defining accurate strain-specific germline references is an essential tool for understanding the development of B and T cells during immune responses. We are producing a haplotype-resolved Immunoglobulin and T cell receptor germline reference assembly using high-fidelity whole genome sequencing on BALB/c and B10.BR mice, followed by de-novo reference assembly, contig-alignment and annotation.

## Project description and aims

We will perform high coverage whole genome sequencing on high molecular weight DNA extracted from BALB/c and B10.BR mouse kidney cells using PacBio Revio. We will then perform de-novo reference assembly, contig-alignment, and annotation to create a haplotype-resolved reference dataset of Immunoglobulin and T cell receptor germline genes.

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

ABLeS is supporting our project by providing access to NCI Gadi to host a range of tasks requiring high levels of computing power to perform de-novo assembly, contig-alignment, and quality control of our large datasets. 

NCI Gadi usage defined by:
gdata 3Tb
scratch 4Tb
20 KSU per quarter 

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

Our work will result in haplotype-resolved Immunoglobulin and T cell receptor germline reference assemblies with minimal bias, covering lesser-documented common laboratory mouse strains, which we aim to publish on publicly available platforms such as OGRDB (the open germline receptor database) and in impactful journals such as Nature Communications.
