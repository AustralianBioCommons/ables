description: Initiated in 2023, this national genomics program aims to transform our understanding of Australiaâ€™s diverse insect populations and support data-informed integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. By generating omics data, the initiative will help sustainably manage insect pests, safeguard agriculture, and promote healthy ecosystems.

## Project description and aims

The data created in this initiative aims to support applications across:
- Accelerate insect identification: expedite identification of pest and beneficial insects to enhance monitoring, establish baselines, and identify unique native species.
- Expand knowledge of insect roles: deepen understanding of insect roles in ecosystems, including adaptation, cryptic species, extinction risks, and predator-prey dynamics.
- Support data-driven pest management: provide insights into insecticide resistance and the impacts of pest control on pollination and ecosystems.
