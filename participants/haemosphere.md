title:  Haemosphere - An online database of blood cell gene expression 
description: Haemosphere is a publicly available resource of transcriptional data for human and mouse blood cells. This allows researchers around the world to access the expression data for their genes of interest, and identify novel genes that are interesting in their field of study. We wish to use an Aus Biocommons to host this server, and also as some space for further development as necessary for maintenance.

## Project description and aims

To have a stable virtual machine to host Haemosphere from.
To have access to other virtual machines to test for maintenance and development.

Haemosphere can be viewed at [www.haemosphere.org](www.haemosphere.org)

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

We would like access to 2 virtual machines from ABLeS
Each with 32GB RAM, 30 GB internal storage, 16 vCPUs (m3.xlarge equivalent) 

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

We expect that this support will enable the continued use of this resource by the scientific community, with further citations of this project.
