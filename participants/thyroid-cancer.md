## Project description and aims

Understanding the immune composition of thyroid tumours is critical for identifying novel therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers. Leveraging single-cell RNA sequencing, this study will profile the tumour immune microenvironment at high resolution, enabling the discovery of cell-type-specific expression patterns and pathway dysregulation.

This project will be implemented on NCI's Gadi HPC, leveraging the open source [nf-core/scrnaseq](https://nf-co.re/scrnaseq) pipeline, and will produce public interactive notebooks for quality control, cell type annotation, differential expression, and biomarker discovery.

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the production bioinformatics scheme provided by ABLeS. The support includes 2TB storage and 25 KSUs per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

A public scalable computational workflow and analytical notebooks for single-cell RNA sequencing in cancer cohorts that can be deployed on NCI Gadi.
