## Project description and aims

This project aims to develop an open-source replication of DeepMind’s Alphafold3 (AF3), the
state of the art tool used for biomolecular structure prediction following DeepMind’s
breakthrough protein structure prediction tool AlphaFold2, for which the Nobel Prize for
Chemistry was awarded in 2024. Along with replicating AF3 in an open-source and user
friendly manner, by making changes to the underlying architecture of the model, we hope to
surpass its performance on certain problems and molecule types.

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the software accelerator scheme provided by ABLeS. The supports includes 100 KSUs per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

Model weights and full inference pipeline will be available via GitHub and HuggingFace.
