## Project description and aims

This project is a use case for the Australian BioCommons Nextflow Tower service. For this use case we will be processing 100 human genomes to identify, annotate and prioritise structural variations in the genome potentially associated with heritable motor neuropathies.


## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the production bioinformatics scheme provided by ABLeS. The support includes 2 TB long term storage, 11 TB temoprary storage on scratch and 50 KSUs per quarter.
