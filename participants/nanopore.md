## Project description and aims

Nanopore is a leading third-generation long-read sequencing technology that can sequence
native DNA and RNA molecules. The output of nanopore sequencers is a current signal
measurement, which is converted to nucleotide bases using a process known as
basecalling. Basecalling of nanopore sequencing data from raw current signals to nucleotide bases is a computationally demanding process that often relies on neural-network inference on GPUs.

In this project, we expect support and then accelerate the basecalling process on multiple
GPU architectures from different vendors, including the AMD GPUs that are available in the
Pawsey supercomputer.

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the software accelerator scheme provided by ABLeS. The supports includes 1 TB long term storage and 20 KSUs per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

An opensource basecaller that can perform basecalling on multiple different GPU
architectures. There could also be preprints or publications, depending on the success of
this project.
