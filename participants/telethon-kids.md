## Project description and aims

Viral-induced wheezing and asthma in children have a significant burden in families and healthcare, with around 20% of all children developing recurrent respiratory disorders during childhood. 

Our team have identified a vulnerable epithelial signature in young children susceptible to viral infections, which may have its developmental links in utero. Although there is a genetic predisposition to asthma (identified through GWAS), exposure and epigenetic regulation (through EWAS) play an important role in asthma development. 

Poorly controlled maternal asthma and prenatal exposures to smoke and viral infections in pregnancy have been identified as risk factors to the development of respiratory disorders. We propose that wheezing in early life is related to an in utero epigenetic reprogramming that can be identified in the amnion, providing new opportunities for early disease prevention. One of our objectives is to determine whether maternal epigenetic imprinting due to smoke exposure is a risk factor for increasing the development of early-life respiratory diseases.
