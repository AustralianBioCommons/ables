## Collaborators and funding

The [Genomics for Australian Plants](https://www.genomicsforaustralianplants.com/) Framework Initiative was initiated by Bioplatforms in partnership with researchers from the Australian State and National Herbaria and Botanic Gardens.
The Initiative is supported by funding from Bioplatforms Australia (enabled by NCRIS), the Ian Potter Foundation, Royal Botanic Gardens Foundation (Victoria), Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria, the Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust, the Council of Heads of Australasian Herbaria, CSIRO, Centre for Australian National Biodiversity Research and the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions, Western Australia.

## Project description and aims

The [Genomics for Australian Plants](https://www.genomicsforaustralianplants.com/) Framework Initiative was initiated by Bioplatforms in partnership with researchers from the Australian State and National Herbaria and Botanic Gardens.
Broadly, the key aims of this part of the Initiative are:

+ Sequence and assemble representative Australian plant genomes across across the plant
tree of life to enable better conservation, utilisation and understanding of Australiaâ€™s unique plant diversity;

+ Build genomic capacity across Australian Botanic Gardens and Herbaria to create networks collaborating in the collection, management, dissemination and application of genomic data for Australian plants;

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the reference data asset creation scheme provided by ABLeS. The support includes 20 TB long term storage, 10 TB temoprary storage on scratch and 450 KSUs per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

24 plant species have been chosen for genome sequencing and assembly where there are
gaps in currently available reference genomes.

The 24 plant genomes will be sequenced, assembled, analysed, submitted to public
repositories, and a descriptive publication written.
