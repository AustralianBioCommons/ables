## Project title
The Ophiuroid project

## Collaborators and funding

## Project description and aims

We have accumulated one of the largest distributional and evolutionary (DNA) datasets
known to marine science (2400 samples x 275 kb). As we continue to add to our dataset, we
aim to:
1. Deliver new internationally-significant understandings of the evolutionary origins of
deep-sea life – where it originated, how it spread around the planet, and when that
occurred.
2. Inform the taxonomic revision of the group and the recognition of new genera and
species.


## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the production bioinformatics scheme provided by ABLeS. The supports includes unlimited temporary storage on scratch, 5 TB permanent storage and 50 KSUs allocation per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

1. Assembly of raw sequence data into an aligned dataset suitable for phylogenetic analysis using custom-built UNIX pipeline and public domain de-novo assemblers (Trinity), contig mappers (BLAST, BLAT), and contig trimmers (Trimmomatic).

2. Generation of phylogenetic trees using RAxML, BEAST and IQTree.

Data will be published in scientific journals and stored in data depositories (e.g. Dryad)
