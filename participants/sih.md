## Project description and aims

"The ""Nextflow for HPC"" workshop will be co-delivered in November 2025 on Setonix and Gadi. The workshop will focus on how users can scale and optimise workflows on these systems. The aim of this project is to test and develop follow-along exercises that demonstrate how users can configure Nextflow pipelines to run with an increasing number of samples, and resources (CPU, RAM, wall time). We expect trial and error with different configuration settings, and toy data sets to ensure that the workshop builds upon introduced concepts, and how users can apply these to their own pipelines.

Analyses conducted within this project should not require a lot of walltime or memory, to fit the time restrictions of a workshop. It will require jobs with multiple CPUs to demonstrate parallelisation and scalability of Nextflow. Test data used will be subset RNA-seq paired-end reads.

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

Both NCI and Pawsey required; 10 kSU/quarter; GPUs not required; Number of users: 5-10; Duration: Until the end of 2025; long term object storage not required, scratch space will be required to store sequencing files (~10 GB) and temporary outputs of nextflow runs (~5GB). 

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

All BioCommons training is archived on Zenodo, and the workshop material will be publicly available on the Sydney Informatics Hub GitHub and GitHub Pages.
