description: The gut-brain axis is a bidirectional communication network linking neural function with the gut microenvironment and is increasingly implicated in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions. We are conducting a large scale meta analysis of thousands of human metagenomes to identify consistent disease associated signatures.

## Project title

## Project description and aims

This project aims to disentangle gut–brain axis signals by conducting large-scale meta-analyses across thousands of publicly available shotgun metagenomes. Our primary objectives are to:
- Taxonomic profiling of shotgun metagenomes to establish baseline microbial composition.
- Taxon set enrichment analysis (TaxSEA) to detect coordinated shifts in functionally related microbial groups.
- De novo assembly–based epitope mining to identify microbial proteins with potential cross-reactivity to host neural or immune epitopes.
- Gene family–level testing to assess functional shifts beyond taxonomy, improving biological interpretability.
- Standardised multi-cohort pipelines for reproducible, scalable meta-analyses.

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?



## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

All outputs will be published in open-access journals as mandated  by our primary funding body, the NHMRC. Any software or pipelines developed will be open source, shared via my lab’s GitHub and deposited in community repositories (e.g. Bioconductor), as we have done previously. Currently, the scale of datasets required particularly for the cross-reactive epitope pipeline is a major barrier on Flinders University infrastructure. This pipeline was initially developed through a Pawsey Preparatory Access Scheme, and ABLeS access is essential to extend it to the full dataset of thousands of samples.
