## Project description and aims

Grapevine cultivars can be unequivocally typed by both physical differences (ampelography)
and basic genetic tests. However, due to their very similar characteristics, the identification
of clones within a cultivar relies on the accurate tracing of supply records to the point of
origin. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) provides the most highly detailed methodology for
defining grapevine cultivars and more importantly, this can be extended to differentiating
clones within those cultivars. WGS is therefore being performed on grapevine germplasm
from across Australia to categorise the genetic variation present in this important crop.

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the production bioinformatics scheme provided by ABLeS. The supports includes unlimited temporary storage on scratch, 1 TB permenant storage and 50 KSUs per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

Outputs will be published in peer-reviewed journals and reference assemblies submitted to
appropriate public repositories for use by the wider community.
