## Project description and aims

Hemp (low THC Cannabis sativa) is an emerging Australian crop that produces high-quality edible oils and plant-based protein from seeds. Hemp typically has separate male and female plants, with 50% of the crop being males that don’t produce seed, causing low and variable yields.

This project will characterize novel sex-determining genetic factors in hemp, using quantitative genetic and functional genomic approaches. This includes Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping, Bulk Segregant Analysis via sequencing (BSAseq), transcriptomic analysis via RNA sequencing, DNA resequencing and potentially de-novo assemblies of Cannabis genomes.

Project outcomes include enhanced knowledge on hemp sex expression, novel hemp crop technologies and associated germplasm that will deliver significant increases to seed yields.
