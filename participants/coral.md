description: Oceans are changing. Coral reefs are wonders of high socio-economic value threatened by climate extremes. To urgently prepare against extinction, this project expects to deliver ground-breaking estimates of coral evolution by integrating genomics and innovative disease models. Expected outcomes include the discovery of reefs that can survive extremes and repopulate other reefs, providing benefits in optimized capabilities to protect resilient and vulnerable reefs to sustain future ecosystem services and boosting Australia as a global leader in the conservation genomics revolution.

## Project title

Adaptation potential of Australiaâ€™s coral reefs to a changing climate

## Collaborators and funding

ARC DECRA DE230100284

## Contact(s)

Kate Quigley, <katemarie.quigley@my.jcu.edu.au>

## Project description and aims

This project will draw on disparate fields (genomics, modelling, and microbial ecology) to resolve coral evolution potential. It will employ a diversity of modelling methods: biophysical connectivity, infectious disease, and the mathematical modelling of adaptation. This project aims to identify reefs that support the most fundamental biological processes for ecosystem-scale resilience: dispersal, symbioses, and adaptation. 

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

8TB Pawsey storage and access to GPUs. Number of users: 1. Expected duration of project funding until 2029. Expected to start: immediate.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

Expected outputs include publications, conference outputs, policy papers, public outreach articles and raw data.
