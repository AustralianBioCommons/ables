## Project description and aims

Scanning SWATH is a novel method that now enables rapid mass spectrometry of hundreds of peptide samples.DIA-NN is a popular tool for processing data-independent acquisition (DIA) proteomics experiments. 
However, throughput of DIA-NN is currently limited and processing large cohorts requires days of computing time and batch processing. 
We will develop a scalable bioinformatics workflow that optimises the execution of DIA-NN for execution on high-performance computing infrastructure and commercial cloud to meet the growing demand of high-throughput proteomics experiments

The workflow will enable rapid generation of unbiased quantitative data concerning the proteins present in high numbers of complex tissue samples, obtained for example under different dietary or genetic conditions. This will enable further mechanistic investigation of the phenotypes observed.

Mouse species will be investigated during this project.
