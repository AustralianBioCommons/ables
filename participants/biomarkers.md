description: This project develops a novel approach using high-resolution confocal imaging of chromatin and epigenetics in single cells to derive cell-type-specific signatures of cellular identity and state, such as biological age, and to approximate organ and organism function. The predictive value of these signatures, demonstrated in mice, is now being expanded to human tissues.

## Project description and aims

This project introduces a novel method to study aging and age-related functional decline by imaging chromatin and epigenetic modifications in single cells. Using high-resolution confocal microscopy, we extract 3D patterns of epigenetic marks to generate cell-type-specific signatures of cellular identity and states, including biological age. We have demonstrated that these signatures can effectively approximate organ and organismal function. Having validated the predictive power of these chromatin and epigenetic signatures in mouse models, our current efforts focus on extending these findings to a diverse range of human tissues and cell types.

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the Production Bioinformatics scheme provided by ABLeS. The support includes 4 TB long term storage and 50 KSUs per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

We aim to publish our findings in high-impact journals such as Nature, Nature Aging, or Cell. The research data will be made publicly available through platforms like The Open Science Framework. Developed analysis methods and corresponding codes developed during this project will be shared on GitHub.
