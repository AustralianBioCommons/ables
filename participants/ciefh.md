## Project description and aims

This project is part of the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Indigenous and Environmental
Histories and Futures (CIEHF)](https://ciehf.au/), which seeks to create a lasting impact by integrating
Indigenous and Western knowledge frameworks to model environmental, cultural, and
historical change in Australia over the past millennium and into the near future. One of its
key approaches leverages sedimentary ancient DNA (sedaDNA) analysis, a transformative
tool for studying past biodiversity and its responses to environmental, climatic, and human-
induced disturbances. However, given the large volume of samples expected to be collected
by CIEHF partners, there is a need to streamline both laboratory workflows and bioinformatic
analyses of sedaDNA sequencing data.

To address this, this project aims to build capacity for the growth of sedaDNA research in
Australia by automating bioinformatic analyses into a single Nextflow pipeline that can easily
produce a validated taxonomic profile of both modern and ancient target species found in
sediment samples.

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the Production Bioinformatics scheme provided by ABLeS. The support includes 5 TB long term storage and 50 KSUs per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

Expected outcomes include an automated computational workflow that improves the ability
to process a broader range of sequencing datasets, including shotgun metagenomics and
target capture enrichment, for sedaDNA analysis. This will enable the large-scale
implementation of sedaDNA analyses and improve accessibility for partner researchers. We
aim to publish these novel findings in high-impact journals, such as Nature, following
consultation with our Indigenous partners.
