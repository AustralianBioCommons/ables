## Project title

Identification of Proteoforms correlating with chemoresistance using a proteoogenomics approach

## Collaborators and funding

## Project description and aims

This project integrates long-read RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry-based proteomics to uncover proteogenomic mechanisms driving chemoresistance in ovarian cancer. The goal is to detect and quantify isoforms and proteoforms that influence drug response and patient outcomes.

Aims
- **Aim 1**: Generate long-read transcriptomic and proteomic data from chemo-sensitive and chemo-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines to build sample-specific protein databases.

- **Aim 2**: Develop a proteogenomic pipeline for accurate isoform-level analysis and detection of low-abundance or non-canonical proteins.

- **Aim 3**: Apply the workflow to patient samples to validate biomarkers and assess predictive value for treatment response.

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?



## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

Expected outputs include generating custom protein databases using GenomeProt from long-read RNA-seq and proteomics data on ovarian cancer. These databases and analysis results will support proteogenomic research on chemoresistance and will be shared via public repositories and publications to promote reproducibility and discovery.
