## Project title
Workspace for Plant Pathogen Omics Initiative

## Collaborators and funding

The Bioplatforms Australia-supported Plant Pathogen Omics Initiative will generate high
quality molecular reference data for plant pathogens in Australia. This data will be developed
through collaboration with the national plant pathogen community.

- Bioinformatics Lead: Dr Benjamin Schwessinger <benjamin.schwessinger@anu.edu.au>
- Project Manager: Dr Mabel Lum <mlum@bioplatforms.com>

## Project description and aims

The Bioplatforms-supported Plant Pathogen Omics Initiative will generate high quality molecular reference data for plant pathogens important to the Australia economy or ecosystems. The data will be developed through collaboration with the national plant pathogen community and will be used as a foundational data asset to support:

- Fundamental research and development in plant protection (e.g., understanding emergence
and evolution of pathogens in crop systems, resolving taxonomy and race structure,
informing biocide development, etc.); and

- An effective national biosecurity surveillance system (e.g., incursion detection, rapid
diagnostics tests, etc.)


## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the reference data asset creation scheme provided by ABLeS. The support includes 5 TB long term storage, 2 TB temoprary storage on scratch and 100 KSUs per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

+ Genome resources for Australian biosecurity, 
+ New workflows, 
+ Publications, and 
+ Policy documents.

Raw data and genomes under embargo will be stored on the Bioplatforms Australia Data Portal. At the time of publication, data will be at NCBI / SRA for long term storage.
