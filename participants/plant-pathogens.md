## Project description and aims

This project aims to investigate plant pathogen genomics, population genetics, virulence evolution, fungicide resistance evolution, and diagnostics.

Methods:

- Genome assembly, 
- Annotation, 
- Population genetics, and 
- Variation analysis


## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the reference data asset creation scheme provided by ABLeS. The support includes 5 TB long term storage, 2 TB temoprary storage on scratch and 100 KSUs per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

+ Genome resources for Australian biosecurity, 
+ New workflows, 
+ Publications, and 
+ Policy documents.

Raw data and genomes under embargo will be stored on the Bioplatforms Australia data portal. At the time of publication, data will be at NCBI / SRA for long term storage.
