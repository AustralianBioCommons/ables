## Project description and aims

The goal of this project is to benchmark software that is commonly used throughout the life sciences on Australia’s national HPC facilities. The software benchmarked will span research areas such as bioinformatics and molecular dynamics, as well as general software that is commonly used such as [`NumPy`](https://bio.tools/numpy) and [`R`](https://bio.tools/r). The benchmarks also aim to test a variety of workloads, such as machine learning & artificial intelligence (ML/AI), traditional HPC (on a small to moderate scale), I/O dependent software (latency and bandwidth), and high throughput workloads.

Life science researchers will benefit from this as it will:

- Assist in planning, and monetary/time budgeting, for grants, 
- Provide a means for researchers to evaluate their own systems’ and/or software performance, 
- Help to differentiate between existing HPC platforms for researchers, and 
- Establish an easy-to-setup benchmarking pipeline – facilitated by [`Nextflow`](https://bio.tools/nextflow).

All results and the pipeline will be made publicly available via GitHub.



## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the production bioinformatics scheme provided by ABLeS. The supports includes 1 TB temprary storage, 1 TB long term storage and 10 KSUs per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

Sharing benchmarking results with the broader bioinformatics comunity in Australia.
