## Project description and aims

Software is critical to the life sciences, and performance of that software is needed for planning of projects, such as predicting funding, applying for grants, and assessing hardware. This project aims to deliver a portable, automated, and configurable pipeline that can be used repeatedly by life science researchers to plan their workloads and test their hardware.

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

ABLeS provides this project with access to Australiaâ€™s largest public HPCs in order to develop and test the pipeline being delivered as part of this project. Critically, access to these HPCs serve as a means to test the portability and configurability of the benchmarking pipeline.

This work is supported through the production bioinformatics scheme provided by ABLeS. The supports includes 1 TB temprary storage, 1 TB long term storage and 10 KSUs per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

Nextflow benchmarking pipeline to be made available on GitHub.
Benchmarking results to be made public (publication platform TBC).
