## Project description and aims

[Janis](https://janis.readthedocs.io/) is an open-source Python tool that has been developed as a working solution to assist with the translation between bioinformatics workflow specifications. The main aim of Janis is to reduce the barriers of entry for users intending to migrate legacy or existing workflows to/from unfamiliar format. This translation also helps make workflows more portable, enabling them to run on a different platform than what the original specifications support. Janis can read in from CWL / WDL / Galaxy, and write out to CWL / WDL / Nextflow. 

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?
This work is supported through the software accelerator scheme provided by ABLeS. The support includes 5 TB long term storage, 1 TB temoprary storage on scratch and 10 KSUs per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

Translated cancer bioinformatics workflows used to test and demonstrate Janis will be made available in [Janis GitHub](https://github.com/PMCC-BioinformaticsCore/janis) and [examples](https://github.com/PMCC-BioinformaticsCore/janis-translate-examples) repositories.
