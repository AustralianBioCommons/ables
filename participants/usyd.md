## Project description and aims

With over 150 independent origins in vertebrates, live birth (viviparity) is one of the most compelling examples of convergent evolution. Squamates (snakes and lizards) represent more independent evolutionary origins of viviparity (n = 115) than all other origins combined.

Reproductively bimodal species, those with both oviparous (egg-laying) and viviparous
populations, provide biologists the opportunity to study the genomic evolution of parity modes.
Squamates are the only vertebrate clade with reproductively bimodal species, and three
species, including Lerista bougainvillii, also have transitionary populations, meaning their
reproductive mode is best described as "in between" oviparity and viviparity. The first aim of the
project is to generate high quality genome assemblies for oviparous, viviparous, and transitional individuals of Lerista bougainvillii. Secondly, we will identify structural variants (SVs) unique to each parity mode. Thirdly, we will identify expression patterns specific to viviparity in maternal and fetal embryonic tissues. Finally, we will integrate these datasets to reveal how SVs
contribute to gene expression profiles that underpin parity mode differences.

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the production bioinformatics scheme provided by ABLeS. The supports includes 3 TB temporary storage on scratch, 5 TB permenant storage and 50 KSUs per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

We aspire to publish results in a leading evolutionary biology journal. Current progress on the project will be presented at the 2024 Genetics Society of Australia Conference. We plan to present the final results at a similar conference. Upon publication, data and code associated with the project will be shared on a publicly accessible repository, facilitating ongoing research of structural variants across other systems.
