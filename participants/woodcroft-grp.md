## Project description and aims

Despite large-scale genome recovery efforts, most microbial species lack a reference genome. We aim to produce novel microbial reference genomes from public metagenomes via new techniques. To this end we have created [Bin Chicken](https://github.com/AroneyS/binchicken/), a tool that predicts the best samples to combine for coassembly, allowing recovery of novel genomes. 

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the reference data generation scheme provided by ABLeS. The supports includes 5 TB long term storage and 100 KSUs per quarter.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

Microbial genomes linked to SRA metadata will be made available on a public database such as NCBI.
Biogeography of newly recovered species will be published in a research article and on the [Sandpiper](https://sandpiper.qut.edu.au/) website.
Publication of results (both direct and downstream) in academic journals.
In each case, the ABLeS scheme will be acknowledged.
