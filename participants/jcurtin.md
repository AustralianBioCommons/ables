## Project description and aims

This project aims to process the soon-to-be-released raw nanopore signal data from the 1000 Genomes Project ONT Long Read Sequencing Consortium (1KGP-ONT) Collection hosted at NCI (de95). These will include unaligned and aligned modBAM files, FASTQ, and VCFs, enabling reanalysis for variant detection, base modification studies, and other genomic investigations.

ModBAM files will serve as the preferred processed data format, containing both read-level information and base modification annotations derived from POD5/BLOW5 inputs. The processing involves computationally intensive modified basecalling workflows that require GPU acceleration.

The processed data will be made publicly available alongside the raw data via the NCI Data Catalogue, expanding access to high-quality ONT long-read resources for the genomics research community. This will accelerate research in population genomics, epigenomics, and human disease.

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the Production Bioinformatics scheme provided by ABLeS. The support includes storage and compute allocation.

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

It will enable the generation of processed datasets derived from the 1KGP-ONT data collection hosted at NCI (de95), including: 

1. FASTQ files for standard sequence analysis; 
2. Unaligned and aligned modBAM files containing read-level and base modification information; 
3. VCF files for variant detection

These outputs will be stored and published via the NCI Data Catalogue alongside the existing 1KGP-ONT raw data, ensuring open access to the research community. Catalogue records will include DOIs, comprehensive metadata, and licensing information to make the data findable.
