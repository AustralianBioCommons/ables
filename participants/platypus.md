description: We will use protein mass spectrometry and transcriptomics to identify the constituent proteins of platypus venom. Candidate proteins identified will then be analysed and screened in assays, to determine their function, associated envenomation symptoms, and potential as novel therapeutics.

## Project description and aims

This project will employ a comprehensive proteogenomic strategy to identify and evaluate novel therapeutic proteins from platypus venom. We will integrate RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to create a detailed map of the venom's protein composition. Venom-derived RNA from this study, supplemented with 61 publicly available platypus tissue samples, will be assembled against the high-quality reference genome to generate a custom, tissue-specific protein database. This database will enable high-confidence identification of proteins from LC-MS/MS analysis of venom fluid. 

The aims include: 
1) *Develop a Platypus Proteome Database*: To assemble transcript sequences from both novel and publicly available RNA-seq data and generate a comprehensive protein sequence database using the Pawsey Setonix cluster. 
2) *Identify Venom Proteins*: To analyze platypus venom fluid using LC-MS/MS and identify its constituent proteins by searching against the custom-generated proteome database. This proteomic database aims to provide novel insights into platypus venom composition, and our understanding of the platypus venom system. 
3) *Evaluate Functionality and Therapeutic Potential*: To clone, express, and purify the identified venom proteins for use in functional assays, to attribute their functionality, associated envenomation symptoms,  and suitability for therapeutic development.

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

Infrastructure choice:  Pawsey
Quarterly Service Units (estimate): 75 kSU
Storage: 3 Tb storage and 1 Tb long term storage 
Is access to GPUs required?: No
Expected number of users: 2
Expected duration of the project: 4 months
We are ready to start using the resources

## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

It is expected that novel platypus venom proteins will be identified through this proteogenomic strategy, and results will subsequently be published in a peer-reviewed academic journal.
