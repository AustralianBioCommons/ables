## Project description and aims

Computational techniques applicable to all species, the focus is optimised and exploratory computation rather than investigation of any particular species. But we have local expertise in: 

- Fundamental evolutionary biology: archeal protein development and divergence into eukaryotes  

- Biomedical therapies in human genetic disorders:  cardiomyopathy implicated protein mutations 


The structural biology node will explore software and hardware efficiencies in the current deep learning revolution in computational structural biology. 
These findings will be shared with local and national HPC facilities, the steering committee, and scientific advisory board in order to formulate best-practice in this new style of compute for biomolecules and drive widespread adoption by biochemical/medical researchers in Australia.   


Aims:  
-  Benchmarking AlphaFold variants (e.g. OpenFold, FastFold) and optimising their use on HPC facilities 
- Apply protein generative AI (e.g. RFDiffusion, EvoDiff, ProteinMPNN) for generation of novel protein designs in fundamental biology (molecular motors) and antibodies therapeutics  
- Validating compilation of CUDA code of the above software onto AMD GPUs.

## How is ABLeS supporting this work?

This work is supported through the production bioinformatics scheme provided by ABLeS. The supports includes unlimited temporary storage on scratch, 5 TB permenant storage and 150 KSUs per quarter.


## Expected outputs enabled by participation in ABLeS

This project is to support the Structural Biology Node being responsive to the deep learning developments in structural biology compute, which is producing pre-print code at a rapid which, many of which find eventual publication in top-rank journals. This is the beginning of software explosion in this ecosystem, and so we will be continually validating new code as the leading-edge validators for wide use by the biological research participant.
