## Events

This page highlights regular events hosted by the ABLeS program, including our *ABLeS User Group meetings*, running twice a year. These gatherings bring together researchers, infrastructure partners, and user groups to share updates, showcase research, and exchange ideas on how ABLeS resources are supporting data-driven life sciences across Australia.

The *Australian BioCommons training program* also offers a range of workshops and webinars that may be of interest to ABLeS users, covering tools, methods, and skills relevant to research computing and life science data analysis. Check the upcoming training available [here](https://www.biocommons.org.au/webinars-workshops).
