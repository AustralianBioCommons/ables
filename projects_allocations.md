title: ABLeS projects and allocations
toc: false
---

If you are new to the ABLeS program, please read the processes below to get started using ABLeS resources. You may also **[contact us](contact-us.md)** for more information and assistance.

## Which ABLeS allocation matches your work?

### Allocation Creation of reference data assets 

ABLeS reference data allocations support research groups and consortia within the life sciences to access the dedicated compute capacity required to efficiently construct reference data.

### Allocation Production bioinformatics

Institutes, consortia and core facilities are increasingly facing issues scaling their in-house compute and data infrastructure to the questions, sample sizes, and data set sizes they are addressing as part of their research programs. ABLeS production allocations support these groups to implement and run their computational workflow approaches for omics data analysis *at scale*.

### Allocation Software accelerator

Software accelerator allocations will directly support the further development, installation, optimisation, testing and/or benchmarking of bioinformatics software. These allocations are intended to create a culture of best practice in software, helping bioinformaticians to effectively share and document their work, and make it [FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-022-01710-x).

## ABLeS process for different stages of a project's lifetime

Australian BioCommons and the bioinformatics leads for each group have different roles during an ABLeS project's initiation, operation and closing phases. 

ABLeS projects are led and maintained by their users with the support of the ABLeS team to facilitate access to ABLeS resources.
